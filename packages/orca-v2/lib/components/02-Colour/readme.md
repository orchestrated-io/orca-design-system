These aren't components to be used, they are simply here to show orchestrated's UI colour palette.

However, the colour props shown in the view code example below demonstrate how our colour variables are named, so if you need to use colour in a custom UI component that isn't part of this design system, you should ensure you at least use one of these colours from the design system palette to keep the UI colours consistent across the app.

```js
<Flex>
  <Colour black />
  <Colour greyDarkest />
  <Colour greyDarker />
  <Colour greyDark />
